# Open MLOps tutorials

Here is a set of guides to get you started with Open MLOps.

* [Set up your production machine learning architecture](./set-up-open-source-production-mlops-architecture-aws.md) shows how to set up and configure the infrastructure in your AWS account.
* [Basic Usage of Jupyter, MLFlow, and Prefect](./basic-usage-of-jupyter-mlflow-and-prefect.md) shows you how to train your first model.
* [Deploying a model to production with Prefect and Seldon](./deploy-model-seldon.md) shows you how to deploy the model you trained the previous tutorial behind a REST API.

If you want help with something specific, feel free to create an issue in this repository - we are building more tutorials soon and always happy to hear ideas.
